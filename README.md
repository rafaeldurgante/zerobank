Challenge 1 - Web 

I created an automated test suite called BackTest.

To run the automated test, you need to download eclipse IDE on your PC and open the Basic Project inside this IDE.

Then right-click on the BankTest class and run JUnit test to check the test cases that passed or failed.

You can also check the test validation screenshots inside the target folder.

● Quality control planning is on Google Spreadsheet - TEST CASE LIST & RUN REPORT

● Created 16 test cases based on requirements link> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lPWIXX8hf7zf0lCBApdz_NY4NoEfD6N5Gynkb0HIVAs/edit#gid=0

● I found 6 bugs on the website (http://zero.webappsecurity.com) and reported them to a bug tracking system inside TRELLO link: https://trello.com/b/9B4irtBq/bug-life-cycle -zero-bank

● I configured in this repository a set of automated tests with 6 test cases for the evaluation of passed and failed test cases
